## Reporting a Vulnerability

Gardin is dedicated to the responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities.

We kindly ask that you **do not** open a public GitHub issue to report security concerns.

Instead, please submit the issue to us directly via: [security@gardin.ag](mailto:security@gardin.ag).

Thank you in advance for collaborating with us to help protect our customers.
